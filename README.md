supersimple-web-ide
===================

Super barebones web ide to be installed server side. Meant for webdesign and web applications development.

My own ide for pretty much any project, including itself. Going to be updating as needed.

Made with CodeMirror. Updated with itself.

Requires a codemirror source copy to root folder of the ide (I will provide it someday); javascript enabled browser somewhat recent, and PHP, say, 5.0.

No security yet. Feel free to implement your own. I recommend .htaccess for apache servers.
No file or folder move, rename. Might someday do it, but for now use FTP, SMB or whatever does it.

Features:

- browse and create files and folders
- upload files (one at a time right now)
- syntax highlighting
- themes
- font sizing
