supersimple-web-ide
===================

Super barebones web ide to be installed server side. Meant for webdesign and web applications development.

My own ide for pretty much any project, including itself. Going to be updating as needed.

Made with Monaco now. Updated through itself.

Requires a monaco distribution copy to the root folder of the ide (I will provide it someday); javascript enabled browser somewhat recent, and PHP, say, 5.0.

Some security implemented. Feel free to implement your own.
No file or folder move. Can delete and rename files and folders.

Features:

- browse, rename, delete and create files and folders
- upload files (one at a time right now)
- syntax highlighting
- font sizing
