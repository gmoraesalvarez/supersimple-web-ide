supersimple-web-ide
===================

Super barebones web ide to be installed server side. Meant for webdesign and web applications development.

Made with CodeMirror.

Requires a codemirror source copy to root folder of the ide (I will provide it); javascript enabled browser, somewhat recent, and PHP >5.0.

No security yet. Feel free to implement your own. I recommend .htaccess.

Features:

- browse files and folders
- upload files (one at a time right now)
- syntax highlighting
- themes
- font sizing
